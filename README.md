# Educational Game For Children With Special Needs

This is a card matching game with three levels of difficulty: easy level has a 2x4 matrix and it is identified with a green color; medium has a 4x4 matrix and it is identified with a blue color; hard has a 4x6 matrix and it is identified with a red color.

_Running the game requires:_
- Python 3.5 or higher
- Library pygame
- Library pygame_menu v4

The levels are defined in the file by their names: easy_app.py for easy, med_app.py for medium, hard_app.py for hard. The folders named after the levels contain the configurations and the asset files (including the cards and the matched screen).

To play the game the file "**main_menu.py**" has to be run, it will run correctly as long as the requirements for the game are fulfilled.

_This game was completed as part of the Senior Project of the DRYKA Team #17_
